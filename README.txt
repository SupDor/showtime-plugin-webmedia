webMedia plugin for Showtime by andreus sebes (andreus.sebes@gmail.com)
=============================================================================

webMedia plugin for Showtime is a free internet source media reader. 
Can read RSS feeds, Imagecast, Podcast, Videocast, Live TV and Live Radio
(rtmp).

I build this plugin for my own use because i wanted more than current
Showtime plugins can give. 
The purpose of this plugin is to have the possibility to read free media
sources avaivable in the Internet.

I thanks Andreas Öman for this wonderfull application that is Showtime and
for all the plugin documentation.
I also thanks facanferff and NP for their excelent plugins.

Installing
=============================================================================

webMedia, in the future, will be available directly from Showtime plugin
repository.

Meanwhile if you want to install it on your PS3 you have 2 options:
1. Copy the webmedia.zip file to a USB pen drive, open Showtime, go to the
   USB pen drive icon and run webmedia.zip file
2. Copy the webmedia.zip file to using a file or FTP manager:
  Showtime plugin path:
  /dev_hdd0/game/HTSS00003/USRDIR/settings/installedplugins/

  Showtime (Multiman version) plugin path:
  /dev_hdd0/game/BLES80608/USRDIR/st_settings/installedplugins/

=============================================================================
Configuring
=============================================================================

======= LOCALIZATION OF SOURCES XML FILE =======

webMedia reads the sources XML file for adding the media sources. 

By default, and only for example purposes, the path of this file is inside
the zip of the plugin localizated in Showtime directory (see "Installing").

You can unzip the plugin, change the "sources.xml" file and, when your done,
zip the plugin again and put it in showtime.
Please note that this only works in unoffical Showtime versions.
(see readFile in  https://github.com/andoma/showtime/blob/master/docs/plugins.md)

You can also change the localization of this file file by putting HTTP or SMB
paths in the plugin settings.

Examples:
- SMB: smb://192.168.1.10/webmedia/sources.xml
- HTTP: http://192.168.1.10/webmedia/sources.xml
- HTTP: http://pastehtml.com/view/bfsgjamdn.html
- HTTP: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=WDVC940d

======= Creating sources XML file =======

Just use the "webmedia-xml-maker.html" file localizated inside the zip of
the plugin.

======= Editing "sources.xml" file =======

Just use the "webmedia-xml-maker.html" file localizated inside the zip of
the plugin for creating a news xml file and then add the new <item> tags
to your old xml file.

======= Live TV and Live Radio RTMPs =======

webMedia, like watchTV plugin (by facanferff), can read rtmp links for
Live TV and Live Radio.
If you want to see more about rtmp links read the excellent tutorial
made by facanferff.

======= Other =======

You can use "[WEBMEDIA]" for indicating a local path inside the plugin file
There is a folder "resources" inside the plugin zip file which contains a
subfolder for each group. You can use it.
